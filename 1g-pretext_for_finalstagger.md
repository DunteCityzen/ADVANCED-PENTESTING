# Pre-Text

What is a pre-text? Well, English is not my 1st language but I like to think of this as a context, for a phishing campaign. Social engineering is IMPORTANT, and most times you only get one shot at this. Getting it right or wrong at this point surpasses any level of technical prowess.

Since auto-open is out of the question at this point, a convincing pre-text is important to get a user to overlook the security warnings that windows throws at user whenever they open a macro enabled document. I'll leave this to your imagination.

Tips though:
1. The pre-text should be able to capture a user's attention quickly.
2. It should have a personal touch. The more specific the more likely a user is to fall for it.

From there, the final vba.
