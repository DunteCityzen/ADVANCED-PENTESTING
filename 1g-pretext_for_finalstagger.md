# Pre-Text

What is a pre-text? Well, English is not my 1st language but I like to think of this as a context, for a phishing campaign. Social engineering is IMPORTANT, and most times you only get one shot at this. Getting it right or wrong at this point surpasses any level of technical prowess.

Since auto-open is out of the question at this point, a convincing pre-text is important to get a user to overlook the security warnings that windows throws at user whenever they open a macro enabled document. I'll leave this to your imagination.

Tips though:
1. The pre-text should be able to capture a user's attention quickly.
2. It should have a personal touch. The more specific the more likely a user is to fall for it.

I'm gonna tell you anyways

## The Pretext
Imagine in an organization where you have the Executive manager sending an email to the Human Resource Manager informing them about the list of the employees to be let go due to the retrenchment. Now here's the gimmick, This person who appearingly looks like the "Executive Manager" has mistaken for the HR since there names are almost similar. Let's say the HR'semail is ronaldkamau@statecorp.com and the target of this phish having an email of ronaldkama@statecorp.com. So it appears like the email was sent to the HR but instead mistakenly ended up with the target. In this email, the Executive Manager also says, " Oh, and if you're prompted for the password, it's Guacamoli3872@#3. Pretty complex huh." 

### The Phishing email

Subject: Confidential: List of Employees to Be Retrenched

From: Executive Manager exec.manager@statecorp.com
To: Ronald Kamau ronaldkama@statecorp.com

Hi Ronald,

As discussed earlier, please find attached the list of employees who will be affected by the upcoming retrenchment. This is a highly confidential matter, and I trust you to handle it with the utmost discretion.

Since we are nearing the end of the fiscal year, it's crucial to finalize these details and inform the concerned departments. Please review the attached document and prepare the necessary paperwork.

Also, just a heads up, if you're prompted for the password to access the document, it's Guacamoli3872@#3. Pretty complex, huh?

Thanks for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Ken Marende
Executive Manager
StateCorp
