# VBA/VBS Dual-Stagger

Unlike VBA, VBS has more breathing room and AV doesn't consider somethings done by VBS as malicious eg, downloading a file, running a file. This to AV doesn't seem malicious, at least not at the time of me writing this.

We write a VBA macro that creates and writes into a file(not malicious) a VBS script line by line as shown in the new_vba.vb file, before executing it. The heavy lifting is left to the VBS file which now downloads our/your payload and executes it.
