# THE PAYLOAD

# C2 infrastructure
This involves a payload and the C2 server.
The payload is what runs on the target machine.

Characteristics of C2 infrastructure
Egress connection: The breached machine should have a mechanism to connect back to our

## Requirements
### C2 server:
* running an ssh server on standard TCP port 443 that doesn't look suspicious. It would seem like the user is just on another https connection.
* 


## Characteristics
The traffic needs to be encrypted yet look like other regular traffic


## APT(Advanced Persistent Threat)
These are groups more sophisticated than the average hackers who just breach systems by casting wide nets and catching low hanging fruit. 
These groups have a specified goal when breaching a system.
Users are used to gain access to corporate networks.

## Characteristics of APTs
1. Initial Compromise: Use of social engineering to gain access through a user.
2. Etablish Beachhead: Access is should be made possible without repeating the initial access process.
3. Escalate privileges: The aim is once landing on a system, is to try and elevate privileges to enable more access and more capabilities normally local admin or domain admin.
4. Internal recon: Collecting information on the surrounding of the compromised system is important to discover trust relationships withing the infrastructure, knowing the domain structure as well.
5. Network Colonization: Lateral movement using acquired credentials to different parts of the network, different hosts etc.
6. Persist: Establish a foothold in the system such that you still have access after a reboot, or network hitches.
7. Goal: APTs usually compromise a system with a specific goal in mind usually to liberate some proprietary data among others.
